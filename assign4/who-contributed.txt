1. First I ran this command:
$ git grep contradictory
This was the output: 
northamerica:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
From this I know the file that contains the statement is northamerica

2. I wanted to see who most recently edited this line so I ran this command: 
$ git blame northamerica -C -C -C | grep contradictory
This was the output: 
c8f960ec7 (Paul Eggert        2013-09-02 08:09:06 -0700  900) # and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
Now I know the most recent person to edit this line was Paul Eggert with the commit c8f960ec7.

3. I wanted to see who edited this line before Paul Eggert's commit so I ran this command: 
$ git blame c8f960ec7^ -C -C -C -- northamerica | grep contradictory
This was the output:
c344c562c (Arthur David Olson 2006-01-30 08:59:12 -0500  681) # and wrote ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''

4. I repeated this same process:
$ git blame c344c562c^ -C -C -C -- northamerica | grep contradictory
c12b43274 (Arthur David Olson 1995-12-21 11:43:42 -0500  540) # and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''

5. When I repeated this process again and ran the following command there was no output so commit c12b43274 was the first to introduce the line:
$ git blame c12b43274^ -C -C -C -- northamerica | grep contradictory

6. I went through and manually inspected each commit to see the lines surrounding the one of interest and found nothing of note. I used the following command where COMMIT represents each of the three commits:
$ git show COMMIT

CONCLUSION: The line was first introduced by Arthur David Olson on December 21, 1995 at 11:43am. It originally read "and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''". It was then modified by him again on January 30, 2006 at 8:59am with him changing "wrote" to "writes". It was then modified one last time by Paul Eggert on September 2, 2013 at 8:09am where he changed the two single quotations and graves `` ... '' to one double "...". 

The line currently reads: and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
It originally read: and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
