Code changes: "If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree object which is however still set to `NULL`). Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case."

How I discovered the information:
First I wanted to find the commits made between version 2.39 and version 2.38 that mentioned the phrase "led to a segfault" so I ran this command:
$ git log --grep="led to a segfault" v2.38.0..v2.39.0

    Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo' into maint-2.38
    
    In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
    merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
    led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
    
    * js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:
      merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
      merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

Both of these are merge commits so next I examined what these commits merged. Both commits have one commit in common (92481d1b26) so this commit must contain the fix I'm looking for. I ran git show 92481d1b26 and the resulting commit message contained this: "In the previous commit, we fixed a segmentation fault when a tree object could not be written." Now I know the fix to the segmentation fault I am looking for is in the parent of this commit. So I ran this command:
$ git show 92481d1b26^

    merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
    
    If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge
    operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree
    object which is however still set to `NULL`).
    
    Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and
    `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case.
