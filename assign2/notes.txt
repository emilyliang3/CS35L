Exercise 2.1
1. long number: (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))
1. # bits: (+ 1 (logb (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))))
   -the above expression evaluates to 1213 bits
2. C-h k C-h k: The *Help* buffer is displayed which contains information about what "C-h k" does and other information such as what it's bound to. The first "C-h k" runs the command describe-key which prompts the user for a key to learn more about. The second "C-h k" is the input for the key to describe. 
3. C-h k M-SPC: Similarly, the *Help* buffer is displayed which contains information about what "C-h M-SPC" does. "C-h k" runs the command describe-key which prompts the user for a key to learn more about and "M-SPC" is the input for the key to describe. By default, M-SPC deletes all spaces and tabs (not newlines) around point, leaving one space. Point is set to just before the beginning of the next word.
4. The general function is cycle-spacing:
(defun cycle-spacing (&optional n preserve-nl-back mode)

Homework: Python Scripting
1. When my shuf.py script is invoked with python2 instead of python3 an error is thrown because I used try, except statements whose syntax changed in python3.
